# git-review: A git command for submitting branches to Gerrit

git-review is a tool that helps submitting git branches to gerrit for review

# Assumptions

git-review, by default, looks for a git remote called gerrit, and submits
the current branch to `HEAD:refs/for/master` at that remote.

# Usage

Hack on some code, then:

```
git review
```

If you want to submit that code to a different target branch, then:

```
git review branchname
```

If you want to submit to a different remote:

```
git -r my-remote review
```
